# Simple 2D Scatterplot using Python


This is a  project that uses matplotlib library to implement a simple algorithm that reads a text file 
to create a x-y graph of the data. The x and y labels are the first elements in the data file. 

## Sample data file

data_1,data_2 <br />
23,98 <br />
27,100 <br />
28,101 <br />
32,99 <br />
29,97 <br />
29,101 <br />
25,99 <br /> 
<br />
Here (data_1) and (data_2) are labels the x and y labels accordingly. 

## Output
This code outputs a 2D graph as well as saves the image as a PNG file. The program asks you what do you want to save the 
graph as, so here you input the name you'd like to give to the output, i.e., the graph image.
